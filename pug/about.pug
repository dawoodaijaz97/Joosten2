                        Maurice Joosten was born in Haarlem, Netherlands in 1962. He studied in Amsterdam at the Academy of Fine Arts and completed a research-fellowship/artist in residency at the Royal Academy of Visual Arts in Amsterdam.

                        He has been working as a professional visual artist since 1988. He moved to Torino, Italy in 1997. In this period, he deeply went into the subject of yoga and non-duality. After completing a public art project for Panasonic in Tokyo in 2003, he moved to Japan.

He has designed natural fragrances for use in public spaces of exclusive hotels, premium car brands, as well as creating natural perfumes for luxury life-style retail brands.

                            “A central theme in my art has always been a search for the ephemeral, the dissolving of boundaries and physicality. 
                            In my earlier sculptures this spiritual search took shape as completely white, lightweight organic forms.
                            In recent years a gradual shift took place in my artistic search from the light towards the dark. Whereas in the earlier works the light was reflected externally through the highly polished white matte surfaces, in the more recent works the light aims to shine from within. 
                            The blackness allows the light to shine and makes it whole.”
