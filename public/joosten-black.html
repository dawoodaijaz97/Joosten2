        <p class="centre mg-bottom">"So the darkness shall be the light"</p>
        <p class="left mg-bottom2">
          From 2006-2012 Joosten gave weekly Sunday yoga classes in a traditional Japanese wooden temple
          Kannon-do (temple of Avalokitesvara) at Chizansoo, Hayama Japan.
          The experience during these meditative sessions in this unique setting over many years,
          has strongly influenced his view on light and shadow.
        </p>
        <p class="italic centre mg-bottom2">“...we find beauty not in the thing itself but in the patterns of shadows, the light and the<br>darkness, that one thing against another creates. (...) Were it not for shadows, there<br>would be no beauty.<br>What lies within the darkness one cannot distinguish, but the palm senses the gentle<br>movements of the liquid, vapor rises from within, forming droplets on the rim, and the<br>fragrance carried upon the vapour brings a delicate anticipation (...)<br>A moment of mystery, it might almost be called, a moment of trance.”<br><span class="centre">(Junichiro Tanizaki, In praise of shadows)</span></p>
        <p class="centre italic">“I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you<br>Which shall be the darkness of God. As in a theatre,<br>The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed<br>With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,<br>And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama<br>And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away-<br>Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations<br>And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence<br>And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen<br>Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;<br>
          <Or>when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing-</Or>
        </p>
        <p class="centre italic mg-bottom2">I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope<br>For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,<br>For love would be the love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith<br>But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.<br>Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:<br>So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.<br>Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.<br>The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,<br>The laughter in the garden echoed ecstasy<br>Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony<br>Of death and birth.”<br>(T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets - East Cocker, third quartet)</p>
        <p class="left mg-bottom2">
          In his recent photography and lightboxes, Joosten explores a darker expanse where
          the light reflects from within.<br>After his move from Japan to Germany in 2013, he started to experiment with black &
          white paper cut-outs and cast resin shapes formed into reliefs, projecting light from
          behind.<br>The photographic works developed by capturing the light projections in an instant of
          movement, the white LED light projected from behind the paper cut-out planes. The laser
          cut light boxes are based on the original paper cut-outs, then further developed and synthesized
          digitally.

        <p class="centre italic mg-bottom">"Life is the light that shines in the darkness!"<br>(Hayao Miyazaki, Nausicaä of the valley of the wind, Vol.7-2 The Crypt)</p>
        <p class="left">
          Creating an infinite black space in which all life appearances begins and end.
          A silent empty void in which sinuous light whisperings emerge, slowly appearing
          and dissolving on the brink of existence. The light breathing, in and out. A caress,
          a sensual dance, embracing the night. A signature coming to life, a scripture fading away.
        </p>
        <p class="left mg-bottom2">
          Like the last moment before falling asleep, when we have laid down our clothes, our various
          roles and identities and slowly dissolve into absolute darkness. Or reversely, as the first
          instant in which we seem to reappear right before awakening. On the brink of darkness, any
          personal story or reference loses its hold.
          Such a silent black void exerts an irresistible appeal as it is the background and the source
          of our being.
        </p>
        <p class="centre italic mg-bottom">“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. "<br>(C.G. Jung “The Philosophical Tree” (1945) In Collected Works13: Alchemical Studies)</p>
        <p class="italic centre mg-bottom2">“To confront a person with his shadow is to show him his own light. Once one has<br>experienced a few times what it is like to stand judgingly between the opposites,<br>one begins to understand what is meant by the self. Anyone who perceives his shadow and his<br>light simultaneously sees himself from two sides and thus gets in the middle.”<br>(C.G.Jung “Good and Evil in Analytical Psychology” (1959) In Collected Works 10. Civilization in Transition.)</p>
